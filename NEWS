v0.1.0 created on Sept. 28, 2019
  (1) add input parameters 'method' and 'fdr' to let the user
choose which method he/she would like to use to determine SNP cluster membership

v0.0.9 created on Sept. 25, 2019

  (1) use limma
v0.0.7 created on Sept. 22, 2019
  (1) remove 'estMemSNPsDiffPriors' and 'estMemSNPsDiffPriors.piAB'

v0.0.6 created on Sept. 22, 2019
  (1) simplify the outputs
  (2) add function 'estMemSNPs.oneSetHyperPara'
  (3) rename function name 'estMemSNPs2' to 'estMemSNPsDiffPriors'
  (4) add function 'estMemSNPs.piAB.oneSetHyperPara'
  (5) add function 'estMemSNPsDiffPriors.piAB'
  (6) remove 'EM.model' and 'genotype.data' from NAMESPACE

v0.0.5 created on Sept. 22, 2019
  (1) add default data
  (2) rename 'simFunc.3cat' to ' simGenoFunc'
  (3) rename 'simFunc.3cat2' to ' simGenoFuncDiffPriors'
  (4) add details for Rd files
v0.0.4 created on Sept. 9, 2019
  (1) add Rd files
v0.0.3 created on Dec. 27, 2018
  (1) add functions 'estMemSNPs', 'estMemSNPs.piAB', 'estMemSNPs2',
      and 'estMemSNPs2.piAB' 
v0.0.2 created on Dec. 27, 2018
  (1) add comments to 'EM.model' to explain inputs
  (2) add input 'memSubj': nx1 binary vector of subject disease status:
      0 stands for healthy subjects; and 1 stands for diseased subjects. 
      'nx' (number of diseased subjects) and 'ny' (number of healthy subjects) 
      will be calculated based on 'memSubj'.
      Note that in v0.0.1, 'nx' was neither defined nor inputed in 'EM.model'
  (3) remove the input 'ny'
  (4) add importFrom("stats", "dbeta", "integrate", "pbeta", "rbeta")
      to NAMESPACE file.
  (5) add row names and column names to the output genotype matrix in
      the function 'genotype.data'
  (6) add Rd files for 'EM.model' and 'genotype.data'
v0.0.1 created on Dec. 27, 2018
  (1) create this package to group SNPs to 3 clusters for identifying
      SNPs associated with disease status
